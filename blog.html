                    <p>Gender Equality is a serious problem that is stealing women's <br> money out of their pocket, Men are prioritized over women. This problem canâ€™t go on as the pay gap is far too high.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gender equality is a huge problem that is not being tackled by a lot of people <br> which makes it even more dangerous for people. In addition to that, this problem makes it even harder for women to cope up with society. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The uncontrolled gender pay gap for Women is 82 cents for every dollar and the <br> controlled pay gap is 98 cents for every dollar </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> It is also seen in offices or workplaces, where women are not paid as much as men for doing the same work. The norm <br> was that male children would receive education while female children would not receive education and would be trained to do housework instead(because that was what people thought women could do at that time).</p>
