                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>Gender Inequality is the problem in which men and women are not treated equally. The treatment might arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, and cultural norms in that area. Gender Inequality is mainly seen as women being lower and men being higher. Gender Inequality is Male Domination in which men are treated as higher individuals.</p>

                    <h3>Where is it seen?</h3>
                    <p>This is seen everywhere. Normally when a woman has a girl child, she is not as excited as when she would have had a boy. It is also seen in offices or workplaces, where women are not paid as much as men for doing the same work. The norm was that male children would receive education while female children would not receive education and would be trained to do housework instead(because that was what people thought women could do at that time).</p>
