                    <h2>How is it inequal?</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Unequal Pay: <br> On average, American women are more educated than men. For decades women have earned more degrees and PhDs. Yet women still earn less than men for the same work. Most of the statistics show that women only earn 80% of what men do. But that depends on the type of woman. Asian women earn 85-90% of men’s salary, white women earn 80% of men’s salaries and black women only earn 50% of what men earn.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sexual Harassment: <br> An obstacle that many women face in the workplace is Sexual Harassment. A survey conducted in 2018 proves that 38% of women face sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Racism: <br> Race is a major obstacle blocking a woman’s pay. Black women earn about 60% of what white women earn. Black women also have a lower chance of getting promoted compared to white women and black women are also harassed at the workplace.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Opportunities: <br> Women are promoted less often than men: Despite being more educated than men, women in the workplace are promoted far less than men. We know this because women are only 5% of the CEOs and less than 10% of women are top earners on the S&P 500. Black women are much worse off. They are nearly invisible on the S&P 500 Boards and the Fortune 500 Boards.</p>
